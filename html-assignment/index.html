        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Taylor, I was born on April 2<sup>nd</sup> 1999 and I am 25 years old. Currently I am studying
            Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College and formerly studied at Carleton University. I graduated from
            Carleton University with a Bachelor's degree in Communications and Media Studies back in 2021. Since
            graduating I have worked in a variety of different fields, all of which have led me to where I am now.</p>
        <p>At the age of 16 I became a lifeguard and advanced swimming instructor with the City of Ottawa and am now one
            of the aquatic supervisors and head-lifeguards. During the pandemic I moved into a temporary position
            with <abbr title="Ottawa Public Health">OPH</abbr> then shortly after went back to aquatics when my contract
            ended. After the pandemic I became an <abbr title="Applied Behaviour Analysis">ABA</abbr> therapist and
            special needs teacher, since at the time, I thought I was going to pursue becoming a teacher. Shortly after
            I then went back to aquatics. Evidently, it was clear I didn't know what I wanted to do with my career.</p>
        <p>This past May I broke my femur. I was admitted to the hospital for three days and underwent surgery in which
            they placed roughly a 12 inch metal plate and 8 screws into my leg. Because of this major injury I became
            unable to work and have been on medical leave ever since my injury. During my recovery I began reflecting on
            myself, my wants, my dreams, and what direction I wanted to go in. Over the past three years my parents have
            encouraged me to go back to school but I wasn't able to decide what I would go back to school for. But
            something changed, something shifted once I broke my leg and it was that unfortunate and painful experience
            that brought me here. In a way I'm grateful this happened to me because otherwise I think I would still be
            where I was before, <em>confused, depressed, and unmotivated.</em>
